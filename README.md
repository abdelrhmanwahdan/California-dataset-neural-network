# California dataset neural network
in this project I am analyzing cleaning and visualizing the California dataset then after that I am doing regression on it using wide and deep neural network by the following steps:
1. Data wrangling (Data gathering , Data assessing , Data cleaning).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis.
3. Making some conclusions about the data.
4. using wide and deep neural network , callbacks and tensor-board.
